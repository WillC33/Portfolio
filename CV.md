## Why Functional Programming

I'm drawn to functional programming because it provides:

- **Correctness by Construction:** Using type systems to eliminate entire classes of bugs
- **Fearless Concurrency:** Immutable data and actor models for reliable concurrent systems
- **Composability:** Building complex systems from simple, testable, pure functions
- **Maintainability:** Code that's easier to reason about, test, and modify
- **Mathematical Elegance:** Programming as applied mathematics with formal foundations

My experience building complete systems in F#, Elixir, and OCaml has convinced me that functional programming is not just academically interestingâ€”it's the most effective way to build robust, maintainable software.
